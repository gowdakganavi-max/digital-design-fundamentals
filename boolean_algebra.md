# Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra is the mathematical foundation of digital logic design. A strong understanding of Boolean laws and simplification techniques is essential for efficient RTL design and verification.

## Basic Operations
- AND
- OR
- NOT

## Fundamental Laws
- Identity Law  
- Null Law  
- Idempotent Law  
- Complement Law  

## Key Theorems
- De Morgan’s Theorems  
- Absorption Law  
- Duality Principle  

## Importance in VLSI
Boolean simplification directly impacts:
- Logic optimization  
- Area efficiency  
- Power consumption  
- Timing performance
