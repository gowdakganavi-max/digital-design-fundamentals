# Digital Design Fundamentals

This repository documents my systematic preparation in **digital design fundamentals** for VLSI front-end and RTL verification roles. It focuses on concept clarity, clean implementation, and design-oriented thinking rather than tool-specific shortcuts.

## Topics Covered
- Boolean Algebra and Logic Simplification  
- Combinational Circuits  
- Sequential Circuits  
- Flip-Flops, Registers, and Counters  
- Timing Concepts and Clocking Basics  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to build a strong conceptual foundation required for **RTL design and verification** roles in semiconductor core companies.

## Future Work
- Verilog-based implementations of core digital blocks  
- Testbench-oriented thinking for basic designs  
- Design trade-offs and timing analysis notes
